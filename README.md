# NLP-PROJECT

Story â€“ 	
	Two techniques were applied on the dataset.
1.	Bag of words (BoW)

	The BoW was used to model the data for further prediction and classify comments as positive or negative.

2.	Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

	I used this technique for topic modeling. I extracted 5 different topics in this dataset.
