# NLP-PROJECT

Story â€“ 	
	Two techniques were applied on the dataset.
1.	Bag of words (BoW)

	The BoW is used to model the data for further prediction and classify comments as positive or negative.
	Three different models were used for training and prediction:
	1. Naive Bayes
	2. Decision Tree
	3. Random Forest
	
	To compare the models performance, four factors includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1_score were calculated.

2.	Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

	This technique is used for topic modeling. In this dataset 5 different topics were extracted.
